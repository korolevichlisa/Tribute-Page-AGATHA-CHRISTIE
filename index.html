        <h3>5 FACTS ABOUT AGATHA CHRISTIE</h3>
        <div class="list">
        <ul>
          <li>She wrote her first detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, after a bet with her sister, Madge.</li>
          <li>In her early years she didn’t go to school but was educated by her mother and a succession of governesses.</li>
          <li>She studied photography at the Reinhardt School and used her new skills to photograph archaeological finds. Unfortunately, Max found the results too artistic; he wanted the objects to appear exactly as they were.</li>
          <li>She was a dog lover. Her first dog was a Yorkshire Terrier puppy which she received as a fifth birthday present. She was so overwhelmed with happiness that she couldn't even say "thank you" and retreated to the lavatory to get her thoughts together. The dog was named Tony– although his full name was George Washington.</li>
          <li>During the First World War she worked first as a VAD nurse in Torquay’s Red Cross hospital, then joined the new hospital pharmacy as an assistant dispenser - thus acquiring her knowledge of poisons. On 13th April 1917 she passed her apothecary exam in London and qualified as a dispenser.</li>
